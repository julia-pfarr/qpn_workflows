# QPN workflows

This is a reporsitory for custom scripts to run imaging and tabular data workflows from QPN neuroimaging study. 

## Imaging workflow
The imaging workflows include utility code for 1) source data (DICOM) curation tasks and 2) extraction of image-derived phenotypes from processing pipelines. 
The stardardized tasks of BIDSifiation and containerized image processing were performed using [Nipoppy](https://nipoppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

## Tabular workflow
The tabular workflows include codes for 1) fetching and cleaning source RedCAP data to generate analysis ready demographics and clinical CSVs, 2) normalization of neuropsych assessments based on several criteria.
